# text adventure engine

to get started:
1. install nodejs and npm
2. run `npm i -D`
3. npm `npm start`
4. a live development server is now running
5. edit `src/data.jsx` to make your game.

you may want to use the `data.blank.jsx` as a template instead of the default one, but the default `data.jsx` has more examples and information.

to make production build

1. run `npm build`
2. modify the `index.production.html` to your liking
3. your build is `adventure.js` and `index.production.html` (rename it to `index.html` or whatever)
